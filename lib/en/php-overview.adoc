== PHP Application Hosting

PHP is a general-purpose server-side scripting language originally designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages.

=== Overview

With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run PHP applications using your favorite frameworks and databases. Want a Zend server backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for CodeIgniter and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

=== Simplify the Lifecycle

Getting a PHP app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp php-5.4
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure PHP, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

As MySQL was deployed for you by the platform, you can connect to it by using connection parameters exposed in the environment variables.

=== Go Enterprise with Zend

Zend Server is a professional-grade PHP runtime environment. Itâ€™s a tested and certified version of the open source PHP engine you already know, plus application deployment and rollback, application monitoring and root cause analysis, advanced debugging, and caching tools. Using Zend Server is a no-brainer if you want to build and run high-quality PHP apps!

The process is similar to deploying general PHP application

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp zend-6.1
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure PHP, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

Or in the Zend Server Console here:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/ZendServer
--

As MySQL was deployed for you by the platform, you can connect to it by using connection parameters exposed in the environment variables.

=== Environment variables

To make your applications more portable, OpenShift shields it from the need to hard-code configuration into the source code. OpenShift provides deployment specific environment variables that the application is supposed to use to configure itself to connect to the correct services. As mentioned, in the previous deployments we deployed MySQL for the application, so these environment variables are automatically available - provided by the platform, the there is no need to configure anything by the user.

|===
|Variable Name|Example|Purpose

|OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST|127.0.250.1|The hostname or IP address to use to connect to your database
|OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT|3306|The port your database server is listening on
|OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME|admin|Your database administrative username
|OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD|8ddTnst22X3Y|Your database administrative user's password
|OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_SOCKET|$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/mysql-5.1/socket/mysql.sock|A AF socket you can use to connect to your database
|OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL|mysql://admin:8ddTnst22X3Y@127.0.250.1:3306/|Database connection URL you can use to connect to your database

=== Rapid Development with an IDE

How you develop your PHP application is up to you. Use your favorite IDE and track and push your changes with Git. But you dislike command line?

For a seamless development experience on OpenShift, use the link:php-jboss.html[JBoss Tools with Eclipse] to deploy your changes to the cloud, tail application log files, and connect to remote databases.

Don't like the command line? No problem! Use the  to create and work with your applications.

=== Build -> Test -> Deploy

Want to make sure your PHP application is stable before your latest changes go live?

link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org[Jenkins] is a full featured continuous integration (CI) server that can run builds, tests, and other scheduled tasks and integrate with your OpenShift applications.

=> link:php-jenkins.html[Build with Jenkins]

=== Scale to Meet Your Needs

Enable your application to react to changes in traffic and automatically allocate the necessary resources to handle your current demand.

The OpenShift infrastructure monitors incoming web traffic and automatically brings copies of your web cartridge on-line to handle requests.
