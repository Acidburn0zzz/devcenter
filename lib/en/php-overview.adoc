PHP is a general-purpose server-side scripting language originally designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages. +

== Simplify your PHP deployments

Getting a PHP app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp php-5.4
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure PHP, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

As MySQL was deployed for you by the platform, you can connect to it by using connection parameters exposed in the environment variables.

== The PHP Cartridge

The `php` cartridge provides http://www.php.net[PHP] on OpenShift.

=== Template Repository Layout
[source]
----
index.php              Template PHP index page
.openshift/            Location for OpenShift specific files
    action_hooks/      See the Action Hooks documentation <1>
    markers/           See the Markers section below
    pear.txt           List of pears to install <2>
----
<1> link:http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_user_guide.html#action-hooks[Action Hooks] documentation
<2> A list of pears to install, line by line on the server. This will happen when the user git pushes.

=== Document root
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#documentroot[Apache DocumentRoot],
the directory that forms the main document tree visible from the web, is selected based
on the existence of a common directory in the repository code in the following order:
[source]
----
1. php/          # for backward compatibility with OpenShift Origin v1/v2
2. public/       # Zend Framework v1/v2, Laravel, FuelPHP, Surebert etc.
3. public_html/  # Apache per-user web directories, Slim Framework etc.
4. web/          # Symfony etc.
5. www/          # Nette etc.
6. ./            # Drupal, Wordpress, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Joomla, Kohana, PIP etc.
----

=== PHP include_path
The following application directories, that might exist in the repository code, are added
to the http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path[PHP include_path] and thus
automatically searched when calling require(), include() and other file I/O functions:
[source]
----
- lib/
- libs/
- libraries/
- src/
- misc/
- vendor/
- vendors/
----

=== Markers
Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Marker |Effect

|force_clean_build
|Will remove all previous deps and start installing required deps from scratch

|hot_deploy
|Will prevent the apache process from being restarted during build/deployment

|disable_auto_scaling
|Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up or down according to application load.
