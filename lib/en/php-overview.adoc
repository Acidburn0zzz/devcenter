With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run PHP applications using your favorite frameworks and databases. Want a Zend server backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for CodeIgniter and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

PHP is a general-purpose server-side scripting language originally designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages. -> link:http://php.net/[Learn more]

Getting a PHP app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp php-5.4
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure PHP, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

As MySQL was deployed for you by the platform, you can connect to it by using connection parameters exposed in the environment variables.
