= Python Environment Variables

The `python` cartridge supports the following environment variables:

OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION:: Set custom path to the WSGI entry-point, eg.
using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION=app/altenative-wsgi.py`
command.
OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH:: Set custom path to the pip requirements file,
eg. using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH=requirements/production.txt`
command.

For some frameworks (such as Django) it is possible to set the `DEBUG` user
environment variable using the `rhc env set DEBUG=True` command.
In that case, Django will run in 'debug' mode, with more verbose logging and
nice error reporting of HTTP 500 errors.
