= Remote Connection

OpenShift allows remote access to your application via the Secure Shell
protocol (SSH). SSH provides direct access to the command line of your
application or gear on the remote server. After you are logged in on the
remote server you can use the command line to directly manage the
server, check logs and test quick changes.

SSH is recommended for advanced users who need to debug their
applications - for more routine tasks use the
link:overview-client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools (rhc)].

To remotely access your application you need to:

* Set up your identity keys
* Install SSH on platforms which do not already have an SSH client
* Connect to a remote application

Some useful SSH commands are also described on this page.

[[setting-up-ssh-keys]]
== Setting up SSH Keys

Each SSH key is a pair - a public key that you share with others, and a
private key that you keep secret. The client encrypts some data using
both the private key and the public key and sends that to the server -
the server can then verify that the data is valid because it has a copy
of the public key. SSH is how both remote access and the Git version
control system are able to prevent tampering and ensure security.

If you already have an SSH key locally, you can log into the management
console and upload the contents of the public key. Any machine which is
properly configured with that key will then be able to use SSH and Git
to access applications belonging to your account.

If you're less familiar with SSH keys and you aren't sure whether you
have generated keys yet, the OpenShift client tools can generate and
upload a key for you through an easy to use wizard.

* Install the link:overview-client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools], if you
haven't already done so.
* From a command line terminal type
+
[source]
--
$ rhc setup
--

This will launch the the setup wizard to configure your OpenShift
account. Enter your user name and password.

* Type *yes* when the wizard
asks if you want to upload your public key. Your public key will be
uploaded and stored on the server.

You can now log into your applications remotely from your computer, or
connect and download the application source code via Git. If you have
multiple computers, repeat the above procedure so that each computer has
access to the application.

[[installing-an-ssh-client]]
== Installing an SSH Client


Most UNIX like platforms like Mac OS X and Linux have SSH installed by
default. However, Windows does not. Many third party SSH clients for
windows are available, however we prefer PuTTY, which is free to use.

* Install and Configure PuTTY for

Windows]

[[connecting-to-your-application-from-windows]]
== Connecting to Your Application from Windows

Once you have an application up and running and your keys are uploaded
to the server you can now SSH into the remote server from your computer.
The link:/page/install-and-setup-putty-ssh-client-for-windows[Windows
SSH page] has instructions on creating a profile for your application
which makes it easy to connect to with a simple mouse click. Create your
profile as described, and connect with a single click to connect, as in
Step Three below.

[[connecting-to-your-application-from-other-platforms]]
=== Connecting to Your Application from Other Platforms

Once you have an application up and running and your keys are uploaded
to the server you can now SSH into the remote server from your computer.
For all platforms, the easiest way to find the specific SSH command that
you will need to connect to your application is to go to the
https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/applications[applications list
page] in the web console and click on your application to go to the
Details page.

To connect to your application:

1. On the Details page click on the *Want to log in to your application?*
link to expand the text. This is the command that you need to connect to
your application.
2. Copy and paste that command to a command line terminal.
3. If you have setup and uploaded your keys correctly a prompt similar to
this displays:

Welcome to OpenShift shell

This shell will assist you in managing OpenShift applications.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!
Shell access is quite powerful and it is possible for you to
accidentally damage your application.  Proceed with care!
If worse comes to worst, destroy your application with 'rhc app destroy'
and recreate it
!!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

Type "help" for more info.

You are now connected to your application and can start debugging or
monitoring it. SSH access is only recommended for advanced users.
