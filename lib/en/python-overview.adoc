= Python Application Hosting
[.lead]
With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Python applications using your favorite frameworks and databases. Want a Tornado server running Django and backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for Flask and MongoDB? OpenShift Online currently supports `Python 2.6`, `2.7`, and `3.3`.

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) defines a simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the Python programming language. -> link:https://www.python.org/[Learn more]

== The Python Cartridges
The `python` cartridges provide http://www.python.org/[Python] on OpenShift. Currently OpenShift Online supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.
Creating different versions is as easy as just changing the number on the cartridge:

[source]
--
rhc app create my2_6app python-2.6

rhc app create my2_7app python-2.7

rhc app create my3_3app python-3.3
--

=== Cartridge Layout
[source]
--
run/           Various run configs (like httpd pid)
env/           Environment variables
logs/          Log data (like httpd access/error logs)
lib/           Various libraries
bin/setup      The script to setup the cartridge
bin/build      Default build script
bin/teardown   Called at cartridge descruction
bin/control    Init script to start/stop httpd
versions/      Version data to support multiple python versions (copied into place by setup
--

=== Markers
Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Marker |Effect

|force_clean_build
|Will cause virtualenv to recreated during builds.

|hot_deploy
|Will prevent shutdown and startup of the application during builds.
|===

=== Environment variables
The `python` cartridge supports the following environment variables:

OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION:: Set custom path to the WSGI entry-point, eg.
using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION=app/altenative-wsgi.py`
command.
OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH:: Set custom path to the pip requirements file,
eg. using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH=requirements/production.txt`
command.

For some frameworks (such as Django) it is possible to set the `DEBUG` user
environment variable using the `rhc env set DEBUG=True` command.
In that case, Django will run in 'debug' mode, with more verbose logging and
nice error reporting of HTTP 500 errors.
