= Python Application Hosting
[.lead]
With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Python applications using your favorite frameworks and databases. Want a Tornado server running Django and backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for Flask and MongoDB? OpenShift Online currently supports `Python 2.6`, `2.7`, and `3.3`.

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) defines a simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the Python programming language. -> link:https://www.python.org/[Learn more]

== Simplify Your Python Deployments

Getting a Python app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp python-3.3
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure Python, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

== The Python Cartridges
The `python` cartridges provide http://www.python.org/[Python] on OpenShift. Currently OpenShift Online supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.

=== Template Repository Layout
[source]
--
wsgi.py                Default WSGI entry-point <1>
setup.py               Standard Setup Script <2>
requirements.txt       Standard pip requirements file <3>
.openshift/            Location for OpenShift specific files
    action_hooks/      See the Action Hooks documentation <4>
    markers/           See the Markers section below
--
<1> For backward compatibility, the `wsgi/application` path is selected as default
    WSGI entry-point with higher priority. You can customize the path using the
    `OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION` envirotnment variable. See the Environment
    variables section below.
<2> Adding dependencies to the `install_requires` section of `setup.py` file will
    cause the cartridge to install those dependencies at git push time.
<3> Adding dependencies to this file will cause the cartridge to run
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` command at git push time. You can customize
    the path using the `OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH` variable. See the
    Environment variables section below.

logs/          Log data (like httpd access/error logs)
lib/           Various libraries
bin/setup      The script to setup the cartridge
bin/build      Default build script
bin/teardown   Called at cartridge descruction
bin/control    Init script to start/stop httpd
versions/      Version data to support multiple python versions (copied into place by setup
--

=== Markers
Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Marker |Effect

|force_clean_build
|Will cause virtualenv to recreated during builds.

|hot_deploy
|Will prevent shutdown and startup of the application during builds.
|===

=== Environment variables
The `python` cartridge supports the following environment variables:

OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION:: Set custom path to the WSGI entry-point, eg.
using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION=app/altenative-wsgi.py`
command.
OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH:: Set custom path to the pip requirements file,
eg. using the `rhc env set OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS_PATH=requirements/production.txt`
command.

For some frameworks (such as Django) it is possible to set the `DEBUG` user
environment variable using the `rhc env set DEBUG=True` command.
In that case, Django will run in 'debug' mode, with more verbose logging and
nice error reporting of HTTP 500 errors.
