Perl is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language. With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Perl applications using your favorite frameworks and databases. Want a Dancer application backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for Mojolicious and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

== Simplify Your Perl Deployments

Getting a Perl app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp perl-5.10
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your gear and install and configure Perl, MySQL, and a git repository. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
