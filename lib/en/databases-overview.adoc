== MongoDB on OpenShift

image::logo-mongodb.png[MongoDB logo]

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, using JSON-style documents with dynamic schemas. With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run applications backed by MongoDB using your favorite servers and frameworks. Just pick an application framework and get started. If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

Looking to scale your application for heavy traffic, or want to automatically build/test/deploy? We've got you covered there too!

== Simplify the Lifecycle

Getting a Python app with a MongoDB backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp python-3.3
$ rhc cartridge add mongodb-2.4 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure Python, MongoDB, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

Don't like the command line? No problem! Use the link:/blogs/getting-started-with-eclipse-paas-integration[JBoss Tools with Eclipse] to create and work with your applications.
