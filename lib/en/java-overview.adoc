With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Java applications using your favorite application servers and frameworks. Want a JBoss server running Spring backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for GlassFish with Scala and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. +
Follow the official documentation to link:https://java.com[learn more].

OpenShift provides several ways to deploy Java applications, including the following environments:

link:#tomcat[Apache Tomcat] +
Spring +

[[jboss]]
== JBoss

With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Java applications on JBoss with your favorite application frameworks and datastores. Want a JBoss server running Spring backed by MySQL? Or maybe you want to run with Scala and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

TIP: Ready to take your JBoss application to the cloud? Now you can with new features in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and JBoss AS 7 like EE6, CDI/Weld, a small memory footprint and lightning fast startup times.

Learn more about link:http://www.jboss.org/[JBoss Application server] and link:http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform].

=== Simplify Your JBoss Deployments

Getting a Java application with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift with JBoss is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp jbossas-7
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure JBoss, MySQL, a git repository on the server, and a simple web application. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

[[tomcat]]
== Apache Tomcat

image::tomcat-power.gif[Powered by Tomcat]

With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Java applications on Apache Tomcat with your favorite application frameworks and datastores. OpenShift supports Apache Tomcat via our JBoss EWS cartridge. Want a Tomcat server running Spring backed by MySQL? Or maybe you want to run with Scala and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

TIP: Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. It powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations.

Learn more at the link:http://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat homepage].

=== Simplify Your Tomcat Deployments

Getting a Java app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift with Tomcat is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp jbossews-2.0
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your server and install and configure Tomcat (via JBoss EWS), MySQL, a git repository on the server, and a simple web application. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
