With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Java applications using your favorite application servers and frameworks. Want a JBoss server running Spring backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for GlassFish with Scala and MongoDB? If it can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 64bit, then it can run on OpenShift.

Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
