=== How can I upgrade my account?
If you are an existing user, the easiest way to upgrade your account is by going to your link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/settings[Account Settings] page and upgrading from there. If you are a new user, you can sign up for the plan you want directly from the link:https://www.openshift.com/pricing[Pricing Page].

=== Can I pay for my Bronze or Silver Plan with Paypal?
Currently OpenShift Online only accepts credit card payments from the US, Canada, and Europe. Please see the link:https://www.openshift.com/pricing[Pricing Page] for more details.

=== Why can't I downgrade to the Free Plan?
In order to downgrade from the Silver or Bronze Plan to the Free Plan, you will need to reduce your account's resource usage to be within the Free plan's resource limits (3 small gears with no additional storage).

=== Can I change my login ID?
Your email address/RHN username serves as the username for your OpenShift account. Currently, our system does not allow username changes.

To work around this limitation as a free user, you can create a new account with the email address you prefer and move your applications to this new account.

This can be accomplished in three easy steps:

*Step 1: Back up your application:*
[source]
--
$ rhc snapshot save <appname>
--
*Step 2: Create a new OpenShift account and run:*
[source]
--
$ rhc setup
--
*Step 3: Restore the backed up application to the new account:*
[source]
--
$ rhc snapshot restore /path/to/snapshot
--

=== Can I change my email address?
If you created an OpenShift Online account with your email address as the username, then you cannot change your email address at this time.

If you created an OpenShift Online account with a Red Hat Network account (RHN), then you can link:https://idp.redhat.com/idp/[log in] and update the email address associated with this account.

=== How can I transfer application ownership from one user to another?
An application can be transferred from one account to another by following these steps:

*Step 1: Backup your application into a local .TAR file:*
[source]
--
$ rhc snapshot-save <app_name>
--

*Step 2: Transfer the .TAR file from Step 1 to the new owner.*

*Step 3: The new owner must create a new application with the same name and cartridges as the original application.*

The original account owner can get this information by running:
[source]
--
$ rhc app-show <app_name>
--

*Step 4: Restore the backed up application to the new account.*

The new owner runs:
[source]
--
$ rhc snapshot-restore <app_name> --filepath <path_to_tar_file>
--

You can then delete the original application as needed.
