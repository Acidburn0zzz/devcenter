[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:marketplace-overview.html#subscribe-service[registered for] and link:marketplace-overview.html#bind-service[bound a service to your app], you will need to configure your application to use the correct credentials for your service.

Credentials for your service can be found within an environment variable prefixed with `memcachier_*` within your application runtime. The full name of the variable matches your *Service Plan ID* in the Marketplace link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/openshift#accounts[web management console] (for example: `memcachier_8b885`).

The `memcachier_*` environment variable holds your credentials, stored as JSON, with the following attributes:
