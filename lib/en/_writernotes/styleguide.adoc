The following styleguide is meant for use in the creation and editing of OpenShift Online developer documents.

== General Points of Emphasis
* Be as clear and concise as possible.
* Avoid unnecessary or overly-casual language.
* Use active voice and avoid passive voice.
* Use example code, commands, or screenshots whenever possible. Avoid long blocks of text whenever possible.
* Use 'you' and 'your', but avoid first-person pronouns such as 'we' and 'our'.

== Page Titles
All documents have a page title (denoted by a '=') located just below the front-matter.

  OTHER FRONT-MATTER HERE...
  meta_desc: MySQL Developers - OpenShift Resources to get your MySQL applications hosted in the cloud.
  ---
  = MySQL Overview //this is the page title

The page title is not to be confused with a headline (see below).

== Headlines
Headlines should use title case (capitalize principle words) except when the title is a filename, command, proper noun or similar word or phrase.

Always start with a first-level headline, which requires a [float] tag in order to render properly:

  [float]
  = MySQL on OpenShift

Do not use more than one first-level headline in a single doc. This first-level headline is typically followed by a [.lead] paragraph, which if used should be a short introduction or summary of the page content. For example:

  [float]
  = What is OpenShift?
  [.lead]
  OpenShift Online is Red Hat's public cloud application development...

The second-level headline will include a horizonal line before it to delimit sections.

  //Horizonal line will render here
  == OpenShift Runtime Environments

Headlines should be in order - avoid using a third-level headline (===) if you haven't used the second-level headline (==). This will not trigger an error, but it will generate a warning and is generally considered poor form.

== In-page Navigation and Anchors
For longer documents or documents with multiple sections, use an in-page table of contents at the top of the document that points to relevant sections. For example:

  link:#step1[Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account] +
  link:#step2[Step 2: Set up the OpenShift Environment] +
  link:#step3[Step 3: Create Your First Application] +
  link:#step4[Step 4: Make Your First Change] +
  link:#tutorials[Language-Specific Tutorials] +

The first link points to the following anchor in the document:

  [[step1]]
  == Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

If you use the above list, also include a [[top]] anchor at the beginning of the document:

  [[top]] //Here is the top anchor that's required
  [float]
  = Getting Started with OpenShift Online
  [.lead]
  It's easy to get up and running on OpenShift...

Add the following link to the end of each section, linking back to the top of the document:

  link:#top[Back to Top]

== Links
Internal links have the following format:

  link:page-name.html[Link Text]

For example:

  link:getting-started-overview.html[Getting Started]

External links are similar but require the http(s) protocol:

  link:http://www.espn.com[ESPN]

Summary or call-to-action links should be preceeded with a '->':

  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Creating_an_Application5.html[-> Learn more about creating and configuring applications with rhc]

Keep link text as short as possible and avoid linking long phrases.

WARNING: If you need to display a URL that begins with http(s): that should NOT be linked, use a preceeding '\' and italicize the URL:

  _\http://appname-namespace.rhcloud.com_

== Including Code (Inline and Code Blocks)
If possible, avoid in-line code. All code should be presented in a code block unless referencing single command names, attributes, variables, filenames, or similar construct.

Normal Code Block:

  [source]
  ----
  $ rhc app create <app_name> <web_language>
  ----

NOTE: For command line source code (as in rhc or git), use a preceeding '$' as in the above example.

NOTE: Placeholders should be enclosed in <>, such as <app_name> in the above example.

Language-specific Code Block:Ã¥

  [source, html]
  ----
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
  ----

Code Block with Notes:

  [source]
  ----
  index.php              Template PHP index page
  .openshift/            Location for OpenShift specific files
      action_hooks/      See the Action Hooks documentation <1>
      markers/           See the Markers section below
      pear.txt           List of pears to install <2>
  ----
  <1> Note for action hooks
  <2> Note for pear.txt

== Admonition Paragraphs/Blocks
An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to auxiliary information. Its purpose is determined by the label at the beginning of the paragraph.

The following admonition blocks are supported:

  NOTE: A note about the preceeding information or relevant aside.

  TIP: A helpful hint or resource.

  IMPORTANT: A crucial piece of information or emphasized point.

  WARNING: A severe warning - missing this point could result in serious errors or complete failure.

  CAUTION: A less-severe point of emphasis, intended to help a user avoid minor gotchas or mild warnings.

A multi-line admonition block can include source code or other asciidoc - USE SPARINGLY:

  NOTE: Some note here...
  ===
  [source]
  ----
  $rhc something amazing
  ----
  ===

== Italics
Use for URLs:

  _\http://appname-namespace.rhcloud.com_

NOTE: The leading '\' prevents a URL beginning with http(s) from being rendered as a link.

== Bold
Use for emphasis or placeholder names:

  ...creates an application titled *mytomcatapp* under the domain *mydomain*.

Use for new vocabulary you are introducing or explaining:

  If you create a *non-scalable* application, which is the default...

Use for mentioning dropdown options, buttons, or interactive page elements:

  In the web console, you can choose the gear size from the *Gears* dropdown:

Use for general emphasis where needed inline:

  Next, select the amount of additional storage you would like to set for *all gears of the specified application cartridge*.

== Monospace or Inline Source Code
Use for inline commands:

  ...perform a `git push`...

Use for variable names, action hooks, markers, etc:

  `OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_IP`

Use for directory and filenames:
  ...`webapps` directory...
  ...modify the `server.xml` file...

Use for cartridge names or language versions:

  ...uses the `JBossEWS` cart...
  `tomcat7` cartridge
