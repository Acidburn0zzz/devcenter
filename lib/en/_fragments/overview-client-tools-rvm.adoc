=== Ruby Version Manager

Ruby Version Manager allows you to install and run multiple versions of
Ruby. When installing the OpenShift client tools gem onto a system with
RVM, you need to install the gem to the global gemset, making it
available to all versions of Ruby.
[source]
-----------------------
$ rvm gemset use global
$ gem install rhc
-----------------------

No matter which version of Ruby you are running, the rhc command will be
available.
