== Setting up the OpenShift Environment on Ubuntu

Use the apt-get command line package manager to install Ruby and Git
before you install the OpenShift command line tools. Run:
[source]
--------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full rubygems git-core
--------------------------------------------------

After you install both Ruby and Git, verify they can be accessed via the
command line:
[source]
----------------------------------
$ ruby -e 'puts "Welcome to Ruby"'
Welcome to Ruby
$ git --version
git version 1.7.11.1
----------------------------------

If either program is not available from the command line, please add
them to your PATH.

With Ruby and Git correctly installed, you can now use the RubyGems
package manager to install the OpenShift client tools. From a command
line, run:
[source]
----------------------
$ sudo gem install rhc
----------------------

If you are using an Ubuntu 11.10 or older (and derivates such as Mint)
and are using the system Ruby, you may see errors related to invalid
date formats when installing the OpenShift client tools gem. You may
need to run the following commands before doing the gem install rhc
command:
[source]
-----------------------------------
$ sudo gem install rubygems-update
$ sudo update_rubygems
-----------------------------------

Read more about https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/57[this
problem and its symptoms].

After the OpenShift client tools are installed, run:
[source]
-----------
$ rhc setup
-----------

The OpenShift interactive setup wizard displays and prompts you to complete the rest
of the process. If you cannot run OpenShift client tools at this point,
please contact us on
https://www.openshift.com/irc[IRC] or visit the
https://help.openshift.com[Help Center] for more assistance.
