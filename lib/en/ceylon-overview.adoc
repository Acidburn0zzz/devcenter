= Ceylon Application Hosting
[.lead]
With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Ceylon applications using your favorite application servers or frameworks. You can run them on WildFly, bare-bones with `ceylon.net` or with Vert.x.

Ceylon is a new programming language that's deeply influenced by Java, designed by people who are unapologetic fans of Java. It's a language designed specifically for writing large programs in teams.

Visit the official Ceylon documentation to link:http://ceylon-lang.org[learn more].

== Supported Technologies
OpenShift provides several ways to deploy Ceylon applications, including the following environments:

=== link:wildfly-overview.html[Wildfly]
OpenShift Online currently supports `Wildfly 8.2 Final`. +
link:/en/wildfly-overview.html[-> Learn More]

=== link:vertx-overview.html[Vert.x]
link:http://vertx.io/[Vert.x] is a lightweight, high performance polyglot application platform for the JVM that's designed for modern mobile, web, and enterprise applications. OpenShift Online currently supports `Vert.x 2.1`. +

== Creating your application

Getting you Ceylon application deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing the following command:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app ceylonapp https://raw.github.com/ceylon/openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

This will create your OpenShift application using the Ceylon cartridge, which will include a template application
running barebones, which you can replace or customise.

For important information on setting up your Ceylon cartridge, check out our link:https://github.com/ceylon/openshift-cartridge/blob/master/template/README.md[documentation] page.

== Even easier application creation

It's trivial to make your application run on OpenShift. Just take your existing application and add the following
import:

[source, ceylon]
--
import ceylon.openshift "1.1.0";
--

This will let you access OpenShift information:

[source, ceylon]
--
import ceylon.openshift { openshift }

void start(String host, int port){
  // ...
}

shared void run(){
  if(openshift.running){
    start(openshift.ip, openshift.port);
  }else{
    start("localhost", 80);
  }
}
--

Similarly you can get information about your database. Read the link:https://modules.ceylon-lang.org/repo/1/ceylon/openshift/1.1.0/module-doc/api/openshift.object.html[API docs for more information].

Now you just have to add the required OpenShift setup to your application, for which
you can install the `ceylon openshift` command (only need to do this once):

[source]
--
$ ceylon plugin install ceylon.openshift/1.1.0
--

And now you just turn your Ceylon application into a Ceylon OpenShift application:

[source]
--
$ ceylon openshift init your.main.module/1.0
--

Then you're ready to start, so just push your code somewhere over git and create your
OpenShift application with the Ceylon cartridge:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app --from-code <your-git-url> ceylonapp https://raw.github.com/ceylon/openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--
