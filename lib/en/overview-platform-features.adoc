[[regions-and-zones]]
== Region and Zone Management
All applications on the *Free Plan* are created on gears within the `us-east-1` Amazon EC2 region.

*Bronze* and *Silver* plans also allow the hosting of applications in the `eu-west-1` Amazon EC2 region.

link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicatednode[*Dedicated Node Services*] offer the ability to host applications in any Amazon EC2 region.

NOTE: Only applications using Small.highcpu, Medium, or Large gears can use additional regions. Small gears can only be created within the `us-east-1` AWS EC2 region.

=== Command Line Tools (RHC)
To view available regions or create an application using a specific region, you can use the OpenShift RHC Command Line Tools (rhc). If you haven't set up RHC, please visit the link:getting-started-client-tools.html[installation guide] first and make sure your version is up to date with the following command:
[source]
----
$ sudo gem update rhc
----

=== Listing Available Regions and Zones
The `region` command is used to list and manage regions and zones.

To list all available regions and zones, use the following command:
[source]
----
$ rhc region list
----

TIP: You can also list available regions using the `rhc regions` command.

To see where an existing application is being hosting, use the following command:

[source]
----
$ rhc app show --gears -a <name>
----

image::overview-multiregion-app-graphic2.png[Multiregion Application Hosting Flowchart]

=== Creating an Application in a Specific Region or Zone
If you have a Bronze or Silver account, you can create an application with Small.highcpu, Medium, or Large gears in a region other than `us-east-1` using the `--region` option:

[source]
----
$ rhc create-app <name> <cartridge> --gear-size <size> --region <region> --scaling
----

For example:

[source]
----
$ rhc create-app racer php-5.4 --gear-size medium --region aws-eu-west-1a --scaling
----

TIP: `create-app` is the same as `app create`.

=== Migrating an Existing Application to Another Region or Zone
The following command will let you migrate an existing app to a different region or zone by creating a copy of your application:

[source]
----
$ rhc create-app <new app name> --from-app <existing app name> --region <region>
----

=== Hosting an Application across Specific Regions or Zones
While OpenShift Online does not directly support multi-region hosting for a single application, it is possible to configure two identical applications to take advantage of multi-region hosting.

IMPORTANT: Using this method requires a Bronze or Silver Plan, along with a shared database service and knowledge of DNS configuration.

==== Step 1: Create two separate identical applications
Create the first application in Amazon `us-east` - this is the default region.

Create the second application in Amazon `eu-west` using the `region` option. For example:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create <app name> <cartridge> --gear-size <size> --region <region> --scaling
--

You can also use the `--from-app` flag to copy an existing application:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app <new app name> --from-app <existing app name> --region <region>
--

==== Step 2: Configure a shared external database
Both applications need to be configured to use the same external database or database service, such as link:https://mongolab.com/[MongoLab] or link:databases-amazon-rds.html[Amazon RDS].

==== Step 3: Configure DNS
Finally, you'll need your DNS provider to manage geoIP or load balancing between your two OpenShift application domains. In addition, you'll want your DNS provider to be able to detect failures.

[[resource-management]]
== Resource Management
All OpenShift Online plans offer 3 free small gears (512MB RAM and 1GB disk space each). Larger gears and additional storage are available on both the Bronze and Silver plans. The premium plans also allow access to additional gears beyond the 3 free small gears provided to all users.

=== In this section
link:#additional-gear-sizes[Additional Gear Sizes] +
link:#additional-gear-storage[Additional Gear Storage] +

[[additional-gear-sizes]]
=== Additonal Gear Sizes
OpenShift currently offers four gear sizes that can be selected at the time an application is created. For all OpenShift users, 3 small gears are available for free. Premium plan customers have access to larger gear sizes and to more gears, allowing the creation of more applications and the ability to scale those applications based on usage.

The following gear prices are in USD. For CAD or EUR pricing, please refer to the plans and https://www.openshift.com/pricing[pricing page].

[cols=".<2,.<4,.<3", width='60%']
|===

| *Small* | $0.02/hr (4 or more) | 512MB RAM
| *Small.highcpu* | $0.025/hr | 512MB RAM
| *Medium* | $0.05/hr | 1GB RAM
| *Large* | $0.10/hr | 2GB RAM

|===

NOTE: Custom gear sizes are avaiable through link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicatednode[Dedicated Node Services].

You can define the gear size of an application during creation through either the web console or the command line tools.

==== Web Console

In the web console, you can choose the gear size from the *Gears* dropdown:

image::overview-platform-features-1.png[Specifying a Gear Size]

==== Command Line (rhc)

You can also define gear size when creating an application using the command line (rhc):

[source]
----
$ rhc app create mediumgearexample php-5.4 --gear-size medium
----

or

[source]
----
$ rhc app create mediumgearexample php-5.4 --g medium
----

[[additional-gear-storage]]
=== Additional Gear Storage

For Free plan users, each small gear has 1GB of storage, which is not expandable. Silver Plan users can expand all gears to 6GB of storage per gear at no additional cost. Bronze and Silver users may add more storage to any gear at a rate of $1.00 / GB / month, up to 30GB per gear.

TIP: Application storage size can be changed through either the web console or the command line tools.

==== Web Console

In the web console, first click on the existing storage amount for the application catridge you want to change:

image::overview-platform-features-2.png[Adding Storage to an Application Cartridge]

Next, select the amount of additional storage you would like to set for *all gears of the specified  application cartridge*.

image::overview-platform-features-3.png[Adding Storage to an Application Cartridge Part 2]

==== Command Line (rhc)

With the command line, you can `--add`, `--set`, or `--remove` additional storage for your applications. You can also view the existing storage allocated to an application:

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge storage --show -a <app_name>
----

*To set storage:*

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge storage php-5 -a <app_name> --set <Storage_Amount(GB)>
----

For example:

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge storage php-5 -a racer --set 5gb
----

[[scaling]]
== Scaling
Application scaling enables your application to react to changes in traffic and automatically allocate the necessary resources to handle your current demand. The OpenShift Online infrastructure monitors incoming web traffic and can automatically add or remove application gears to handle changes in request volume.

All plans allow the creation and management of scalable applications on OpenShift, but the free plan is limited to three small gears. Premium plans allow applications to be scaled from 1 to 16 gears (and beyond), and offers you full control over the minimum and maximum gears available to an application.

NOTE: Applications on premium plans will never idle.

=== In this section

link:#managing-application-scaling[Managing Application Scaling] +
link:#scalable-vs-non-scalable[Scalable Versus Non-scalable Applications] +
link:#how-scaling-works[How Scaling Works] +
link:#supported-cartridges[Supported Cartridges] +

[[creating-a-scalable-application]]
=== Creating a Scalable Application
You must specify whether or not an application can scale when you create the application.

NOTE: By default, applications created on OpenShift Online are not scalable.

If a scalable application is created, the scaling function of that application cannot be disabled. However, it is possible to clone a non-scaling application and all its associated data using the application clone command. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Cloning_an_Existing_Application.html[OpenShift Online User Guide] for more information on cloning an application.

==== Web Console

When creating an application, select *Scale with web traffic* from the *Scaling* dropdown:

image::overview-platform-features-4.png[Creating a Scalable Application]

==== Command Line (rhc)

When creating an application, the `-s` flag instructs OpenShift to enable scaling.

For example:

[source]
----
rhc app create scaledappexample php-5.4 -s
----

link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Creating_an_Application5.html[-> Learn more about creating scalable applications on OpenShift]

[[managing-application-scaling]]
=== Managing Application Scaling
A scalable application defaults to using one gear at a minimum and will use as many gears as you have available on your account. OpenShift allows you to set a minimum and maximum scale via the web console or the CLI.

==== Web Console
First, select the application you wish to scale from the list of existing applications. In the screen for the individual application, you can see what the current scaling settings are for each cartridge associated with the application. Click on the current scaling settings of a specific cartridge (in the following shot, *1-15* in the *Scales* section of the php-5.4 cartridge) to update the minimum and maximum number of gears:

image::overview-platform-features-5.png[Changing Scaling Settings Part 1]

Next, define the new *Minimum* and *Maximum* gear amount for the cartridge:

image::overview-platform-features-6.png[Changing Scaling Settings Part 2]

NOTE: If your new minimum is different than you old minimum, the application cartridge will immediately scale up or down when you click *Save*.

==== Command Line (rhc)
You can change the default scaling settings with the following command:

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge scale <your web cart> -a <app_name> --min <minimum> --max <maximum>
----

For example:

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge scale php-5.4 -a scaledappexample --min 1 --max 3
----

If you set the minimum scale above the current minimum, OpenShift will begin scaling up your application, and the operation won't finish until all of your gears are created.

NOTE: If you specify `-1` as the `max` you'll scale up to your account limit.

CAUTION: Sometimes your scale up request will return a timeout error, but the operation will continue on the server.

link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Scaling_an_Application_Manually.html[-> Learn more about managing application scaling on OpenShift Online]

[[scalable-vs-non-scalable]]
=== Scalable Versus Non-scalable Applications
If you create a *non-scalable* application, which is the default, the web cartridge occupies only a single gear and all traffic is sent to that gear. If you add other cartridges like MongoDB or MySQL, those cartridges will share the same gear and resources as your web cartridge.

When you create a *scalable* application, the HAProxy cartridge is added as a load balancer to your first web cartridge gear. If you add other cartridges like MongoDB or MySQL to your application, they are installed on their own dedicated gears.

link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/chap-Applications.html#Scaled_and_Non-Scaled_Applications1[-> Learn more about scalable vs. non-scalable applications]

[[how-scaling-works]]
=== How Scaling Works
The *HAProxy cartridge* sits between your application and the public internet and routes web traffic to your web cartridges. When traffic increases, HAProxy notifies the OpenShift servers that it needs additional capacity. OpenShift checks that you have a free gear (out of your remaining account gears) and then creates another copy of your web cartridge on that new gear. The code in the git repository is copied to each new gear, but the data directory begins empty. When the new cartridge copy starts it will invoke your build hooks and then the HAProxy will begin routing web requests to it. If you push a code change to your web application all of the running gears will get that update.

The first web gear in a scaling application has HAProxy installed, but also your web application. Once you scale to 3 gears, the web gear that is collocated with HAProxy is turned off, to allow HAProxy more resources to route traffic. Here's a http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_system_architecture_guide.html#horizontal-scaling[diagram] of your scalable app. If you scale down back to 2 gears or less, the web cartridge on your first gear is started again.

The algorithm for scaling up and scaling down is based on the number of concurrent requests to your application. OpenShift allocates 16 connections per gear - if HAProxy sees that you're sustaining 90% of your total connections, it adds another gear. If your demand falls to 50% of your total connections for several minutes, HAProxy removes that gear.

Because each cartridge is 'shared-nothing', if you want to share data between cartridges you can use a database cartridge. Each of the gears created during scaling has access to the database and can read and write consistent data.

The OpenShift web console shows you how many gears are currently being consumed by your application.

[[supported-cartridges]]
=== Supported Scaling Web Cartridges
Most of the standard OpenShift link:languages-overview.html[web cartridges] are scalable using HAProxy, with the exception of the *Do-It-Yourself*, *Jenkins*, and *Zend* cartridges.

[[domain-management]]
== Domain Management
All OpenShift Online plans allow you to create and use a custom _rhcloud.com_ subdomain, along with the ability to use your own custom domain name. All applications can also utilize a shared SSL certificate. Premium plans allow the creation and management of more than one domain and the ability to use a custom SSL certificate.

=== In this section
link:#creating-additional-domains[Creating Additional Domains] +
link:#using-a-custom-domain[Using a Custom Domain] +
link:#using-a-custom-ssl-certificate[Using a Custom SSL Certificate] +

[[creating-additional-domains]]
=== Creating Additional Domains
Premium plan users can create a new domain in either the web console or by using the command line (rhc).

==== Web Console
If you have already created an application on OpenShift Online, you will see a list of your existing applications. If you are a premium plan user, click on the *Create* link in the applications list as highlighted in the screenshot below. You can also create and manage domains from the *Settings* tab in the top navigation:

image::overview-platform-features-7.png[Creating a new domain part 1]

Next, provide your desired domain name:

image::overview-platform-features-8.png[Creating a new domain part 2]

The additional domain is then ready to use. On the *Applications* screen, you can see an empty domain has been created:

image::overview-platform-features-9.png[Creating a new domain part 3]

You can now select the new domain when creating additional applications:

image::overview-platform-features-10.png[Creating a new domain part 4]

==== Command Line (rhc)

[source]
----
rhc domain create <domain_name>
----

IMPORTANT: If you are using the command line with multiple domains to create and manage applications, you will need to use the `-n <domain>` flag for most commands to identify the domain you are referencing.

link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/chap-Domains.html[-> Learn more about managing domains on OpenShift Online]

[[using-a-custom-domain]]
=== Using a Custom Domain
The web console allows you to configure your application's hostname, and set up secure access to custom domains through the SSL certificate configuration area. Once you have your own domain name and at least one application, you can start the configuration process.

==== Step 1: Configure a Domain Alias in the OpenShift Web Console or Command Line (rhc)
First, open your OpenShift web console, and select the app that you would like to modify. On the application's settings page, there is a *Change* link next to your initial OpenShift-provided hostname:

image::overview-platform-features-11.png[Adding a domain alias]

Clicking this link will open up the new hostname configuration page:

image::overview-platform-features-12.png[Adding a domain alias part 2]

Here you can enter the domain name that you would like to associate with your application. The above example uses _\http://parks.ryanjarvinen.com/_.

Configuring your application to be available on a subdomain is generally easier.

Click *Save*, at the bottom of the page when you're ready to save your settings.

You should see a notification message if the host alias was configured successfully:

image::overview-platform-features-13.png[Adding a domain alias success]

===== Command Line (rhc)
You can add a custom domain name to an existing application with the following command, specifying the application name and custom domain name:

[source]
----
$ rhc alias add <application name> <custom domain name>
----

Additional host aliases can be added as needed.

link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/sect-Custom_Domains_and_SSL_Certificates.html[-> Learn more about custom domains and SSL certificates on OpenShift Online]

==== Step 2: Configure your DNS Host Records
OpenShift takes advantage of *CNAME* records to route requests to your application instance.

CNAME records are nice because they can defer to OpenShift's DNS system for IP address resolution (which isn't guaranteed to be static in OpenShift Online). However, CNAME records can also come with a few hidden limitations:

. Not all Domain registrars allow you to set your base host name as a CNAME (_www.foo.com_ is allowed, while _foo.com_ may not be).
. If your registrar does allow you to configure a root-level CNAME record, then link:http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc1912#section-2.4[all additional Host records will like be limited to the CNAME record type as well]. This means that you would not be able to configure MX records on any host that uses a CNAME for it's root host record ("@").

The simplest solution is to make your app available on a subdomain, as in the above example (_\http://parks.ryanjarvinen.com/_). This configuration is supported by all domain registrars, and it doesn't limit your ability to set up an external mail provider.

Here is a screenshot of the _parks.ryanjarvinen.com_ subdomain being tied to the Red Hat-hosted _parks-shifter.rhcloud.com_:

image::overview-platform-features-14.png[Configuring DNS]

NOTE: When in doubt, check your domain registrar's support documents for DNS Host record configuration assistance.

Shortly after adding the CNAME record, you will be able to connect to your application via the new hostname URL.

link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/sect-Custom_Domains_and_SSL_Certificates.html[-> Learn more about custom domains and SSL certificates on OpenShift Online]

[[using-a-custom-ssl-certificate]]
=== Using a Custom SSL Certificate
OpenShift includes support for link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[Server Name Identification], which improves support for link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#How_SNI_fixes_the_problem[TLS] by sending your OpenShift-configured domain alias as a part of the handshake.

You can always take advantage of our **.rhcloud.com* wildcard certificate in order to securely connect to any application via it's original, OpenShift-provided hostname URL.

Support for enabling *HTTPS* connections to custom, aliased hostnames is available for users of https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing[OpenShift Online's premium plans].

If you are still getting by on the link:https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing[Free Plan], you'll see a warning message at the top of your application's SSL configuration area. Upgrading to the Bronze or Silver plan adds support for providing your own SSL cert.

==== Web Console

image::overview-platform-features-15.png[SSL Certificate]

After saving, you should be able to make HTTPS-based connections to your hosted application on your custom domain.

==== Command Line (rhc)
You can add a custom SSL certificate to an alias with the following command:

[source]
----
$ rhc alias update-cert <application_name> <domain_name> --certificate <cert_file> --private-key <key_file>
----

If the private key is encrypted, specify the passphrase with the --passphrase option.

==== Generating a CSR (Certificate Signing Request)

===== Where should I generate the CSR?
You can either generate the CSR on your workstation (if you have openssl installed) or ssh to your gear (`rhc app ssh`) to generate your CSR.  Either way should work fine.

TIP: It can help to create your files with the name of the domain that you are creating them for, this helps keep them all organized.  The following guide uses *example.com* to represent whatever domain you are creating your CSR for.  Feel free to use this method, or your own.

===== Generate a private key
Enter the following command (either on your workstation or once you have SSHed to your gear) and hit *Enter*.  This will create a 2048-bit key that you will use to create your CSR.  You will also need this file when you load your SSL certificate into the OpenShift Web Console.

You must enter a passphrase during this step, but don't worry, you can remove it later.  If you plan on removing the passphrase just choose something simple like 'password'.

[source]
----
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out example.com.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
..................+++
.....................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for example.com:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for example.com.key:
----

===== Generate the CSR
Now that you have a private key you can generate the CSR.  Enter the below command and hit *Enter*, making sure that you are in the same directory as the key file you generated earlier.  Enter the same passphrase that you used earlier when generating your key file.

Now you are ready to enter the information for the CSR.  The most important part is to make sure that the "Common Name" matches the domain name that you are going to use with your OpenShift application.  Fill in all of the other fields to the best of your knowledge. You do not need to include a "challenge password" or "optional company name".

[source]
----
$ openssl req -new -key example.com.key -out example.com.csr
Enter pass phrase for example.com.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:North Carolina
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Raleigh
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Red Hat, Inc
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:OpenShift
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:www.example.com
Email Address []:postmaster@example.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:Red Hat, Inc
----

Now you should have two files, *example.com.key*, and *example.com.csr*.

===== (Optional) Remove the Passphrase from the Key file
You do NOT have to remove the passphrase from the key file, OpenShift supports key files with passphrases and provides a field to enter the passphrase when installing the certificate.

Use the below commands to remove the passphrase from your key file, make sure that you enter the same passphrase that you used when creating the key earlier.

[source]
----
$ cp example.com.key example.com.key.temp
$ openssl rsa -in example.com.key.temp -out example.com.key
Enter pass phrase for example.com.key.temp:
writing RSA key
----

===== What do I do with all of these files?
The CSR file is what you submit to the company that you are purchasing your SSL Certificate from.  Once you have submitted that file, they will send you a ZIP file with more files in it, including your SSL Certificate and any Chain Certificates that you might need.

For more information on how to install your new SSL Certificate on OpenShift link:#using-a-custom-ssl-certificate[click here].

[[collaboration]]
== Collaboration
All OpenShift Online plans allow you to mange users that have access to one or more of your OpenShift domains. Premium plans extend this functionality by allowing for additional domains and management of teams.

=== In this section
link:#managing-domain-membership[Managing Domain Membership] +
link:#team-management[Team Management] +

[[managing-domain-membership]]
=== Managing Domain Membership
All OpenShift Online users have the ability to add collaborators at the domain level. Other OpenShift users can be given access to either View, Edit, or Administer applications associated with a shared domain. The default role for additional members is `edit`.

==== Web Console
After logging into the web console, you will see a list of your current domains and applications. Click on the domain you would like to share. You can also select the domain from the *Settings* tab in the top navigation. In the below example, the domain *exampledomainone* is selected from the *Applications* list:

image::overview-platform-features-16.png[Managing domain membership step 1]

Next, you will see the details of the domain you've selected. All current OpenShift users that have access to this domain will be listed under the *Members* section. If there are no members, as in the example below, you can click on *Add members...*

image::overview-platform-features-17.png[Managing domain membership step 2]

You can then add new users to the domain, granting either *view*, *edit*, or *administer* access for the user. The user will have access to all applications associated with this domain. Bronze and Silver users will also have the option of adding a team to the domain (see below).

image::overview-platform-features-18.png[Managing domain membership step 3]

Once the new user is added, they will be able to access applications in the shared domain by logging into their own individual OpenShift Online account.

==== Command Line (rhc)
Add a user to a domain with the following command, specifying the user login and domain name.

TIP: The user login must be a registered OpenShift Online user.

[source]
----
$ rhc member add <openshift_username> -n <domain_name>
----

When a member is added to a domain, they receive the default role of edit. Use the --role option when adding a member to specify a different role:

[source]
----
$ rhc member add <openshift_username> -n <domain_name> --role <member_role>
----

TIP: The three roles available are +view+, +edit+, and +administer+.

[[team-management]]
=== Team Management
After logging into the web console, you will see a list of your current domains and applications. Click on the *Settings* tab in the top navigation:

image::overview-platform-features-19.png[Team Management Step 1]

If you have any existing domains or teams, you will see them listed here. If not, select *Create a new team*:

image::overview-platform-features-20.png[Team Management Step 2]

Enter the name of the team you would like to create:

NOTE: A team name must be a unique name between 2 and 250 characters, and cannot be modified once created.

image::overview-platform-features-21.png[Team Management Step 3]

Once the team is created, you can add members to the team:

image::overview-platform-features-22.png[Team Management Step 4]

You can then add or remove existing OpenShift Online users to the new team:

image::overview-platform-features-23.png[Team Management Step 5]

Once the team is created, you can then give the team access to one or more of your existing domains. First from either the *Applications* list (shown below), or the *Settings* tab, select the domain you wish to share:

image::overview-platform-features-24.png[Team Management Step 6]

On the domain settings screen, you can choose to add members to the domain. A member can be either an individual user or a team that you've created:

image::overview-platform-features-25.png[Team Management Step 7]
