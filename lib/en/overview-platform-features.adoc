link:#additional-gear-storage[Additional Gear Storage] +

[[additional-gear-sizes]]
=== Additonal Gear Sizes
OpenShift currently offers three gear sizes that can be selected at the time an application is created. For all OpenShift users, 3 small gears are available for free. Premium plan customers have access to larger gear sizes and to more gears, allowing the creation of more applications and the ability to scale those applications based on usage.

The following gear prices are in USD. For CAD or EUR pricing, please refer to the plans and https://www.openshift.com/pricing[pricing page].

[cols=".<2,.<4,.<3", width='60%']

| *Small* | $0.02/hr (4 or more) | 512MB RAM

| *Medium* | $0.05/hr | 1GB RAM

| *Large* | $0.10/hr | 2GB RAM

|===

You can define the gear size of an application during creation through either the web console or the command line tools.

==== Web Console

In the web console, you can choose the gear size from the *Gears* dropdown:

image::overview-platform-features-1.png[Specifying a Gear Size]

==== Command Line (rhc)

You can also define gear size when creating an application using the command line (rhc):

[[additional-gear-storage]]
=== Additional Gear Storage

For Free plan users, each small gear has 1GB of storage, which is not expandable. Silver Plan users can expand all gears to 6GB of storage per gear at no additional cost. Bronze and Silver users may add more storage to any gear at a rate of $1.00 / GB / month, up to 30GB per gear.

IMPORTANT: Application storage size can be changed through either the web console or the command line tools.

==== Web Console

In the web console, first click on the existing storage amount for the application catridge you want to change:

image::overview-platform-features-2.png[Adding Storage to an Application Cartridge]

Next, select the amount of additional storage you would like to set for *all gears of the specified  application cartridge*.

image::overview-platform-features-2.png[Adding Storage to an Application Cartridge Part 2]

==== Command Line (rhc)

With the command line, you can add, set, or remove additional storage for your applications.

*To set storage:*

[source]
--
$ rhc cartridge storage php-5 -a App_Name --set Storage_Amount(GB)

[[scaling]]
== Scaling
Application scaling enables your application to react to changes in traffic and automatically allocate the necessary resources to handle your current demand. The OpenShift Online infrastructure monitors incoming web traffic and can automatically add or remove application gears to handle changes in request volume.

All plans allow the creation and management of scalable applications on OpenShift, but the free plan is limited to three small gears. Premium plans allow applications to be scaled from 1 to 16 gears (and beyond), and offers you full control over the minimum and maximum gears available to an application.

IMPORTANT: Applications on premium plans will never idle.

link:#supported-cartridges[Supported Cartridges] +

[[creating-a-scalable-application]]
=== Creating a Scalable Application
You must specify whether or not an application can scale when you create the application. By default, applications created on OpenShift Online are not scalable.

If a scalable application is created, the scaling function of that application cannot be disabled. However, it is possible to clone a non-scaling application and all its associated data using the application clone command. See https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Cloning_an_Existing_Application.html[the OpenShift Online User Guide], “Cloning an Existing Application” for more information.

==== Web Console

When creating an application, select *Scale with web traffic* from the *Scaling* dropdown:

image::overview-platform-features-4.png[Creating a Scalable Application]

==== Command Line (rhc)

When creating an application, the +-s+ flag instructs OpenShift to enable scaling.

_For example:_

[source]
rhc app create scaledappexample php-5.4 -s

https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Creating_an_Application5.html[Learn more about creating scalable applications on OpenShift]

[[managing-application-scaling]]
=== Managing Application Scaling
A scalable application defaults to using one gear at a minimum and will use as many gears as you have available on your account. OpenShift allows you to set a minimum and maximum scale via the web console or the CLI.

==== Web Console
First, select the application you wish to scale from the list of existing applications. In the screen for the individual application, you can see what the current scaling settings are for each cartridge associated with the application. Click on the current scaling settings of a specific cartridge (in the following shot, '1-15' in the 'Scales' section of the php-5.4 cartridge) to update the minimum and maximum number of gears:

image::overview-platform-features-5.png[Changing Scaling Settings Part 1]

Next, define the new minimum and maximum gear amount for the cartridge:

image::overview-platform-features-6.png[Changing Scaling Settings Part 2]

If your new minimum is different than you old minimum, the application cartridge will immediately scale up or down when you click 'Save'.

==== Command Line (rhc)
You can change the default scaling settings with the following command:

[source]
--
rhc cartridge scale <your web cart> -a <your app> --min <minimum> --max <maximum>
--

_For example:_

[source]
--
rhc cartridge scale php-5.4 -a scaledappexample --min 1 --max 3
--

If you set the minimum scale above the current minimum, OpenShift will begin scaling up your application, and the operation won't finish until all of your gears are created.

NOTE: If you specify +-1+ as the +max+ you'll scale up to your account limit.

CAUTION: In rhc, sometimes your scale up request will return a timeout error, but the operation will continue on the server.

https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/Scaling_an_Application_Manually.html[Learn more about managing application scaling on OpenShift Online]

[[scalable-vs-non-scalable]]
=== Scalable Versus Non-scalable Applications
If you create a *non-scalable* application, which is the default, the web cartridge occupies only a single gear and all traffic is sent to that gear. If you add other cartridges like MongoDB or MySQL, those cartridges will share the same gear and resources as your web cartridge.

When you create a *scalable* application, the HAProxy cartridge is added as a load balancer to your first web cartridge gear. If you add other cartridges like MongoDB or MySQL to your application, they are installed on their own dedicated gears.

https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/chap-Applications.html#Scaled_and_Non-Scaled_Applications1[Learn more about scalable vs. non-scalable applications]

[[how-scaling-works]]
=== How Scaling Works
The *HAProxy cartridge* sits between your application and the public internet and routes web traffic to your web cartridges. When traffic increases, HAProxy notifies the OpenShift servers that it needs additional capacity. OpenShift checks that you have a free gear (out of your remaining account gears) and then creates another copy of your web cartridge on that new gear. The code in the git repository is copied to each new gear, but the data directory begins empty. When the new cartridge copy starts it will invoke your build hooks and then the HAProxy will begin routing web requests to it. If you push a code change to your web application all of the running gears will get that update.

The first web gear in a scaling application has HAProxy installed, but also your web application. Once you scale to 3 gears, the web gear that is collocated with HAProxy is turned off, to allow HAProxy more resources to route traffic. Here's a http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_system_architecture_guide.html#horizontal-scaling[diagram] of your scalable app. If you scale down back to 2 gears or less, the web cartridge on your first gear is started again.

The algorithm for scaling up and scaling down is based on the number of concurrent requests to your application. OpenShift allocates 16 connections per gear - if HAProxy sees that you're sustaining 90% of your total connections, it adds another gear. If your demand falls to 50% of your total connections for several minutes, HAProxy removes that gear.

Because each cartridge is "shared-nothing", if you want to share data between cartridges you can use a database cartridge. Each of the gears created during scaling has access to the database and can read and write consistent data.

The OpenShift web console shows you how many gears are currently being consumed by your application.

[[supported-cartridges]]
=== Supported Scaling Web Cartridges
Most of the standard OpenShift https://www.openshift.com/developers/technologies[web cartridges] are scalable using HAProxy, with the exception of the Do-It-Yourself, Jenkins, and Zend cartridges.

[[domain-management]]
== Domain Management
All OpenShift Online plans allow you to create and use a custom rhcloud.com subdomain, along with the ability to use your own custom domain name. All applications can also utilize a shared SSL certificate. Premium plans allow the creation and management of more than one domain and the ability to use a custom SSL certificate.

=== In this section
link:#creating-additional-domains[Creating Additional Domains] +
link:#using-a-custom-domain[Using a Custom Domain] +
link:#using-a-custom-ssl-certificate[Using a Custom SSL Certificate] +

[[creating-additional-domains]]
=== Creating Additional Domains

Premium plan users can create a new domain in either the web console or by using the command line (rhc).

==== Web Console

If you have already created an application on OpenShift Online, you will see a list of your existing applications. If you are a premium plan user, click on the *Create* link in the applications list as highlighted in the screenshot below. You can also create and manage domains from the Settings tab in the top navigation:

image::overview-platform-features-7.png[Creating a new domain part 1]

Next, provide your desired domain name:

image::overview-platform-features-8.png[Creating a new domain part 2]

The additional domain is then ready to use. On the Applications screen, you can see an empty domain has been created:

image::overview-platform-features-9.png[Creating a new domain part 3]

You can now select the new domain when creating additional applications:

image::overview-platform-features-10.png[Creating a new domain part 4]

==== Command Line (rhc)

[source]
--
rhc domain create <domain name>
--

IMPORTANT: If you are using the command line with multiple domains to create and manage applications, you will need to use the +-n <domain>+ flag for most commands to identify the domain you are referencing.

https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/chap-Domains.html[Learn more about managing domains on OpenShift Online]

[[using-a-custom-domain]]
=== Using a Custom Domain
The web console now allows you to configure your application's hostname, and set up secure access to custom domains through a new SSL certificate configuration area. Once you have your own domain name and at least one application, you can start the configuration process.

==== Step 1: Configure a Domain Alias in the OpenShift Web Console or Command Line (rhc)
First, open your OpenShift web console, and select the app that you would like to modify. On the application's settings page, there is a "Change" link next to your initial OpenShift-provided hostname:

image::overview-platform-features-11.png[Adding a domain alias]

Clicking this link will open up the new hostname configuration page:

image::overview-platform-features-12.png[Adding a domain alias part 2]

Here you can enter the domain name that you would like to associate with your application. The above example uses *http://parks.ryanjarvinen.com/*.

Configuring your application to be available on a subdomain is generally easier.

Click *Save*, at the bottom of the page when you're ready to save your settings.

You should see a notification message if the host alias was configured successfully:

image::overview-platform-features-13.png[Adding a domain alias success]

===== Command Line (rhc)
You can add a custom domain name to an existing application with the following command, specifying the application name and custom domain name:

[source]
--
$ rhc alias add <application name> <custom domain name>
--

Additional host aliases can be added as needed.

https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/sect-Custom_Domains_and_SSL_Certificates.html[Learn more about custom domains and SSL certificates on OpenShift Online]

==== Step 2: Configure your DNS Host Records
OpenShift takes advantage of CNAME records to route requests to your application instance.

CNAME records are nice because they can defer to OpenShift's DNS system for IP address resolution (which isn't guaranteed to be static in OpenShift Online). However, CNAME records can also come with a few hidden limitations:

. Not all Domain registrars allow you to set your base host name as a CNAME ("www.foo.com" is allowed, while "foo.com" may not be).
. If your registrar does allow you to configure a root-level CNAME record, then http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc1912#section-2.4[all additional Host records will like be limited to the CNAME record type as well]. This means that you would not be able to configure MX records on any host that uses a CNAME for it's root host record ("@").

The simplest solution is to make your app available on a subdomain, as in the above example (*http://parks.ryanjarvinen.com/*). This configuration is supported by all domain registrars, and it doesn't limit your ability to set up an external mail provider.

Here is a screenshot of the *parks.ryanjarvinen.com* subdomain being tied to the Red Hat-hosted *parks-shifter.rhcloud.com*:

image::overview-platform-features-14.png[Configuring DNS]

IMPORTANT: Remember: when in doubt, check your domain registrar's support documents for DNS Host record configuration assistance.

Shortly after adding the CNAME record, you will be able to connect to your application via the new hostname URL.

https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/sect-Custom_Domains_and_SSL_Certificates.html[Learn more about custom domains and SSL certificates on OpenShift Online]

[[using-a-custom-ssl-certificate]]
=== Using a Custom SSL Certificate
OpenShift includes support for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[Server Name Identification], which improves support for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#How_SNI_fixes_the_problem[TLS] by sending your OpenShift-configured domain alias as a part of the handshake.

You can always take advantage of our **.rhcloud.com* wildcard certificate in order to securely connect to any application via it's original, OpenShift-provided hostname URL.

Support for enabling *HTTPS* connections to custom, aliased hostnames is available for users of https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing[OpenShift Online's Premium plans].

If you are still getting by on the https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing[Free Plan], you'll see the following warning message at the top of your application's SSL configuration area. Upgrading to the Bronze or Silver plan adds support for providing your own SSL cert.

==== Web Console

image::overview-platform-features-14.png[SSL Certificate]

After saving, you should be able to make HTTPS-based connections to your hosted application on your custom domain.

==== Command Line (rhc)
You can add a a custom SSL certificate to an alias with the following command:

[source]
--
$ rhc alias update-cert <application name> <domain name> --certificate <cert file> --private-key <key file>
--

If the private key is encrypted, specify the passphrase with the --passphrase option.

[[collaboration]]
== Collaboration
All OpenShift Online plans allow you to mange users that have access to one or more of your OpenShift domains. Premium plans extend this functionality by allowing for additional domains and management of teams.

=== In this section
link:#managing-domain-membership[Managing Domain Membership] +
link:#team-management[Team Management] +

[[managing-domain-membership]]
=== Managing Domain Membership
All OpenShift Online users have the ability to add collaborators at the domain level. Other OpenShift users can be given access to either View, Edit, or Administer applications associated with a shared domain. The default role for additional members is +edit+.

==== Web Console
After logging into the web console, you will see a list of your current domains and applications. Click on the domain you would like to share. You can also select the domain from the *Settings* tab in the top navigation. In the below example, the domain _brutusbeefcake_ is selected from the Applications list:

image::overview-platform-features-16.png[Managing domain membership step 1]

Next, you will see the details of the domain you've selected. All current OpenShift users that have access to this domain will be listed under the Members section. If there are no members, as in the example below, you can click on *Add members...*

image::overview-platform-features-17.png[Managing domain membership step 2]

You can then add new users to the domain, granting either view, edit, or administer access for the user. The user will have access to all applications associated with this domain. Bronze and Silver users will also have the option of adding a team to the domain (see below).

image::overview-platform-features-18.png[Managing domain membership step 3]

Once the new user is added, he/she will be able to access applications in the shared domain by logging into their own individual OpenShift Online account.

==== Command Line (rhc)
Add a user to a domain with the following command, specifying the user login and domain name.

TIP: The user login must be a registered OpenShift Online user.

[source]
--
$ rhc member add <openshift user name> -n <domain name>
--

When a member is added to a domain, they receive the default role of edit. Use the --role option when adding a member to specify a different role:

[source]
--
$ rhc member add <openshift user name> -n <domain name> --role <member role>
--

TIP: The three roles available are +view+, +edit+, and +administer+.

[[team-management]]
=== Team Management
After logging into the web console, you will see a list of your current domains and applications. Click on the Settings Tab in the top navigation:

image::overview-platform-features-19.png[Team Management Step 1]

If you have any existing domains or teams, you will see them listed here. If not, select *Create a new team*:

image::overview-platform-features-20.png[Team Management Step 2]

Enter the name of the team you would like to create. A team name must be a unique name between 2 and 250 characters, and cannot be modified once created:

image::overview-platform-features-21.png[Team Management Step 3]

Once the team is created, you can add members to the team:

image::overview-platform-features-22.png[Team Management Step 4]

You can then add or remove existing OpenShift Online users to the new team.

image::overview-platform-features-23.png[Team Management Step 5]

Once the team is created, you can then give the team access to one or more of your existing domains. First from either the Applications list (shown below), or the Settings tab, select the domain you wish to share:

image::overview-platform-features-24.png[Team Management Step 6]

On the domain settings screen, you can choose to add members to the domain. A member can be either an individual user or a team that you've created.

image::overview-platform-features-25.png[Team Management Step 7]

Select *Add a team...*

image::overview-platform-features-26.png[Team Management Step 8]

Select a team you've created from the dropdown:
