[.lead]
IronWorker is an elastic task queue / worker service that scales to handle whatever workloads you send it. Every production-scale application needs to do work in the background. IronWorker gives you a reliable way to run tens, hundreds, or thousands of tasks at once. Queue tasks from your app, schedule jobs to run later, or fire off tasks from webhooks. No need to stand up servers or manage queues. IronWorker scales out the processing to let you focus on building apps at scale.

Credentials for your service can be found within an environment variable prefixed with `ironworker_*` within your application runtime. The full name of the variable matches your *Service Plan ID* in the Marketplace link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/openshift#accounts[web management console] (for example: `ironworker_8b885`).

The `ironworker_*` environment variable holds your credentials, stored as JSON, with the following attributes:
