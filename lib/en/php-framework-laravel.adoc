= Laravel PHP Framework on OpenShift

[float]
= Deploying Laravel 5.0 on OpenShift
link:http://laravel.com/[Laravel] is a free, open source PHP web application framework, designed for the development of model-view-controller (MVC) web applications.

The simplest way to install this application is to use the link:https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/115-laravel-5-0[Laravel 5.0 OpenShift QuickStart]. If you'd like to install it manually, follow link:#manual-installation[these directions].

== OpenShift Considerations
These are some special considerations you may need to keep in mind when running your application on OpenShift with the Laravel QuickStart.

=== Local vs. Remote Development
This Laravel QuickStart provides separate `.env` configuration files for both local and remote development, found at `.env` and `.openshift/.env` respectively. When the local repo is pushed to OpenShift `.env` is overwritten with the `.openshift/.env` file.

=== Remote Development
Your application is configured to automatically use your OpenShift MySQL or PostgreSQL database in when deployed on OpenShift using link:managing-environment-variables.html[OpenShift Environment Variables].

Additionally, your `APP_ENV`, `APP_URL`, and `APP_KEY` will be set automatically in production on OpenShift.

The Laravel `CACHE_DRIVER` is set to use link:http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php[APC opcode caching] and the `SESSION_DRIVER` is set to use the local file system for storage. Feel free to update these settings in `.openshift/.env`.

=== Laravel Migrations
When the application is pushed to OpenShift, `php artisan migrate --force` is automatically executed.

=== Composer
When the application is pushed, `composer install` is automatically executed over the root directory. See [PHP Markers](https://developers.openshift.com/en/php-markers.html) for more details on the 'use_composer' marker.

=== 'Development' Mode
When you develop your Laravel application in OpenShift, you can also enable the 'development' environment by setting the `APPLICATION_ENV` environment variable, using the `rhc` client, like:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc env set APPLICATION_ENV=development
----

If you do so, OpenShift will run your application under 'development' mode. In development mode, your application will:

* Set Laravel's `APP_ENV` to 'development'
* Ignore your `composer.lock` file
* Show more detailed errors in browser
* Display startup errors
* Enable the link:http://xdebug.org/[Xdebug PECL extension]
* Enable link:http://php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php#ini.apc.stat[APC stat check]

Using the development environment can help you debug problems in your application in the same way as you do when developing on your local machine. However, we strongly advise you not to run your application in this mode in production.

=== Log Files
Your application is configured to use the OpenShift log directory. You can use the `rhc tail` command to stream the latest log file entries:

[source, console]
----
rhc tail -a <APP_NAME>
----

To stop tailing the logs, press *Ctrl + c*.

== Manual Installation

1. Create an account at link:https://www.openshift.com/[https://www.openshift.com/]

2. Create a Laravel application with `mysql-5.5` or `postgresql-9.2`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ rhc app create laravelapp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luciddreamz/openshift-php/master/metadata/manifest.yml mysql-5.5 --from-code=https://github.com/luciddreamz/laravel
----

NOTE: The Laravel 5.0 QuickStart is setup to use a link:https://github.com/luciddreamz/openshift-php[custom version] of the OpenShift PHP 5.4 cartridge with the latest version of Composer installed. The version of Composer that ships with OpenShift's current PHP 5.4 cartridge is slightly out of date will error when it encounters Laravel's more recent version syntax (ex. Invalid version string "^1.0.1").

Documentation for the Laravel framework can be found on the link:http://laravel.com/docs[Laravel website].
