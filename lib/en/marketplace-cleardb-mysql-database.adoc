The ClearDB dashboard allows you to manage your database, monitor performance, access backups, and view your credentials. You can also manage your support cases, among other things.

[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:marketplace-overview.html#subscribe-service[registered for] and link:marketplace-overview.html#bind-service[bound a service to your app], you will need to configure your application to use the correct credentials for your service.

Credentials for your service can be found within an environment variable prefixed with `cleardb_*` within your application runtime. The full name of the variable matches your *Service Plan ID* in the Marketplace link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/openshift#accounts[web management console] (for example: `cleardb_8b885`).

The `cleardb_*` environment variable holds your credentials, stored as JSON, with the following attributes:

[source, javascript]
----
{
  "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://a6bc2e19e4di54:a107a37e@us-cdbr-iron-east-01.cleardb.net:3306/ad_e2530aa1edi1ae6",
  "uri": "mysql://a6bc2e19e4di54:a107a37e@us-cdbr-iron-east-01.cleardb.net:3306/ad_e2530aa1edi1ae6?reconnect=true",
  "name": "ad_e2530aa1edi1ae6",
  "hostname": "us-cdbr-iron-east-01.cleardb.net",
  "port": "3306",
  "username": "a6bc2e19e4di54",
  "password": "a107a37e"
}

NOTE: Check out the general link:marketplace-overview.html#code-examples[code examples] to see how to use Marketplace enviornment variables within your application.

[[code-examples]]
== Code Examples
The following code example shows how to easily configure your application to connect to a MySQL database provided by ClearDB.

=== PHP
Connecting to ClearDB from PHP merely requires the parsing of the `cleardb_*` environment variable and passing the extracted connection information to your MySQL library of choice, e.g. MySQLi:

[source, php]
----
<?php
// get account info from OpenShift environment variable
$service_plan_id = "cleardb_8b885"; // update with your plan ID
$account_info = json_decode(getenv($service_plan_id), true);

$conn = new mysqli(
 $account_info['hostname'],
 $account_info['username'],
 $account_info['password'],
 $account_info['name'],
 $account_info['port']
);
?>
----

You can then issue queries against the database using `$conn->query()`.
