image::marketplace/sendgrid_dashboard.png[SendGrid Dashboard]

SendGrid offers statistics on a number of different metrics to report on what is happening with your messages including:

- *Alerts*: SendGrid will trigger an alert to send you based on triggers you set within SendGrid.
- *Categories*: SendGrid will allow you to filter email statistics based on specific categories you add to your emails.
- *Email Activity*: A page within your account that allows you to see recent stats on your sent emails.
- *Email Error Messages*: All of the Error messages that you can expect from SendGrid.
- *Email Reports*: View and export reports about your email activity.

[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:marketplace-overview.html#subscribe-service[registered for] and link:marketplace-overview.html#bind-service[bound a service to your app], you will need to configure your application to use the correct credentials for your service.

Credentials for your service can be found within an environment variable prefixed with `sendgrid_*` within your application runtime. The full name of the variable matches your *Service Plan ID* in the Marketplace link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/openshift#accounts[web management console] (for example: `sendgrid_8b885`).

The `sendgrid_*` environment variable holds your credentials, stored as JSON, with the following attributes:

{
  "password": "adsRvqPZra",
  "hostname": "smtp.sendgrid.net",
  "username": "DM12KPNLIq"

$account_info = json_decode(getenv($service_plan_id), true);

$this->load->library('email');

$this->email->initialize(array(
  'protocol' => 'smtp',
  'smtp_host' => $account_info['hostname'],
  'smtp_user' => $account_info['username'],
  'smtp_pass' => $account_info['password'],
  'smtp_port' => 587,
  'crlf' => "\r\n",
  'newline' => "\r\n"
));

$this->email->from('your@example.com', 'Your Name');
$this->email->to('someone@example.com');
$this->email->cc('another@another-example.com');
$this->email->bcc('them@their-example.com');
$this->email->subject('Email Test');
$this->email->message('Testing the email class.');
$this->email->send();

echo $this->email->print_debugger();
----

TIP: It is important to use the correct end of lines using "crlf" => "\r\n" and "newline" => "\r\n".

See more information on how to link:http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/email.html[use CodeIgniter with SendGrid].

[[php-laravel]]
=== PHP: Laravel
Laravel comes with an email sending library built in, so we just need to set it to use SendGrid over SMTP.

In `app/config/mail.php` you need to configure these settings:

[source, php]
----
<?php
// get account info from OpenShift environment variable
$service_plan_id = "sendgrid_8b885"; // your OpenShift Service Plan ID
$account_info = json_decode(getenv($service_plan_id), true);

return array(
  'driver' => 'smtp',
  'host' => $account_info['hostname'],
  'port' => 587,
  'from' => array('address' => 'from@example.com', 'name' => 'John Smith'),
  'encryption' => 'tls',
  'username' => $account_info['username'],
  'password' => $account_info['password'],
);

?>
----

You can use Laravel's Mail class just like you normally would, but all email will be sent through SendGrid!

[source, php]
----
Mail::send('emails.demo', $data, function($message)
{
    $message->to('jane@example.com', 'Jane Doe')->subject('This is a demo!');
});
----

Check out the docs for link:http://laravel.com/docs/mail[Laravel's mailer] for details.

[[php-wordpress]]
=== PHP: WordPress
Download the link:https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified.zip[Official SendGrid WordPress Plugin].

Extract the zip archive file and move the Plugin folder to the `.openshift/plugins` directory of your repository (or to your `wp-content/plugins` folder if you're not using the default OpenShift WordPress installation).

Add the following code to `.openshift/config/wp-config.php` in your local repo:

[source, php]
----
// get account info from OpenShift environment variable
$service_plan_id = "sendgrid_8b885"; // UPDATE WITH YOUR OpenShift Service Plan ID
$account_info = json_decode(getenv($service_plan_id), true);

// set credentials
define('SENDGRID_USERNAME', $account_info['username']);
define('SENDGRID_PASSWORD', $account_info['password']);

// set email related settings
define('SENDGRID_SEND_METHOD', 'api');
----

Next, add and commit your changes link:managing-modifying-applications.html[using git]:

[source]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds fully configured SendGrid WordPress Plugin"
----

Deploy your changes to your live WordPress application with git:

[source]
----
$ git push
----

Next, you'll need to *activate the plugin* from the "Plugins" menu in the WordPress admin panel.

Finally, on the SendGrid plugin settings page you can set default values for the "Name", "Sending Address" and the "Reply Address", so that you don't need to set these headers every time you want to send an email from your application.

image::marketplace/sendgrid_dashboard.png[configure the SendGrid WordPress plugin settings]

That's it! WordPress emails will now be sent through SendGrid. For more information check out the link:https://wordpress.org/plugins/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified/[official plugin page].

account_info = json.loads(os.getenv(service_plan_id))

EMAIL_HOST = account_info['hostname']
EMAIL_HOST_USER = account_info['username']
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = account_info['password']
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
----

Then to send email you can do the following:

[source, python]
----
from django.core.mail import send_mail
send_mail('Subject here', 'Here is the message.', 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'], fail_silently=False)
